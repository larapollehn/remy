# DNA alignment visualization

Visualization of algorithms like Needleman-Wunsch for nucleotide alignment.

The DNA are the fundamental building blocks of a living cell and are made up of nucleotide chain.

There are four kinds of nucleotide, each differentianted from each other by its Nucleobase `guanine`, `adenine`, `cytosine` and `thymine`.

# Needleman-Wunsch

Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch introduced 1970 an approach to compute the optimal global alignment of two sequences for comparing two nucleotide or amino acid sequences.
